# Simple Banking App

A RESTful API built with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) that simulates basic banking operations. The app allows you to manage users, create bank accounts, and perform transactions (deposits, withdrawals, transfers). Every operation is logged, and you can audit all transactions through a dedicated endpoint.

---

## 1. Introduction

The Simple Banking App is designed to demonstrate a clean, modular REST API built with NestJS. It includes:

- **User Management:** Create and retrieve users.
- **Account Management:** Create bank accounts for users. The same user cannot create multiple accounts with the same name.
- **Transactions:** Perform deposits, withdrawals, and transfers between accounts. All operations are logged as transactions.
- **Audit:** Retrieve all transactions for auditing purposes.
- **Precision Handling:** Monetary amounts are managed using BigNumber and accepted as strings to preserve decimal precision.
- **Swagger Documentation:** Interactive API docs generated via Swagger.

## 2. Running in Production Mode

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Build the application:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
3. **Start in production mode:**
   ```bash
   npm run start:prod
   ```
The app will run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by default.

You can access the swagger interface to access the api at [http://localhost:3000/api](http://localhost:3000/api)

## 3. Running in Development Mode

For development with hot-reloading:

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Start in development mode:**
   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```
The app will run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and auto-reload on code changes.

You can access the swagger interface to access the api at [http://localhost:3000/api](http://localhost:3000/api)

## 5. Manual Testing with Swagger

1. **Start the application** (in development or production mode).
2. **Open Swagger UI** by navigating to [http://localhost:3000/api](http://localhost:3000/api).

### Testing Steps via Swagger

1. **Create Users:**
   - Use the `POST /users` endpoint to create two users:
     - **User 1:**
       ```json
       {
         "name": "John Doe",
         "email": "john@example.com"
       }
       ```
     - **User 2:**
       ```json
       {
         "name": "Jane Smith",
         "email": "jane@example.com"
       }
       ```
   - Note the returned `userId` for each user.

2. **Create Bank Accounts:**
   - Use the `POST /accounts` endpoint to create accounts:
     - **Account for User 1:**
       ```json
       {
         "name": "John's Savings",
         "ownerUserId": "user1-id-from-step-1",
         "startingBalance": "1000.00"
       }
       ```
     - **Account for User 2:**
       ```json
       {
         "name": "Jane's Checking",
         "ownerUserId": "user2-id-from-step-1",
         "startingBalance": "500.00"
       }
       ```
   - Note the `accountId` from each response.

3. **Perform Transactions:**
   - **Deposit:**  
     Use `POST /accounts/{accountId}/deposit` with:
     ```json
     {
       "userId": "user1-id-from-step-1",
       "amount": "250.00"
     }
     ```
   - **Withdrawal:**  
     Use `POST /accounts/{accountId}/withdraw` with:
     ```json
     {
       "userId": "user1-id-from-step-1",
       "amount": "100.00"
     }
     ```
   - **Transfer:**  
     Use `POST /accounts/transfer` with:
     ```json
     {
       "userId": "user1-id-from-step-1",
       "fromAccountId": "account1-id-from-step-2",
       "toAccountId": "account2-id-from-step-2",
       "amount": "200.00"
     }
     ```

4. **Test Error Handling:**
   - **Insufficient Funds:**  
     Test the application's handling of withdrawal or transfer attempts that exceed available funds:
     ```json
     {
       "userId": "user1-id-from-step-1",
       "amount": "5000.00"  // Amount greater than account balance
     }
     ```
     The API should return a 400 Bad Request with a message about insufficient funds.
   
   - **Same Account Transfer:**  
     Attempt to transfer money to the same account:
     ```json
     {
       "userId": "user1-id-from-step-1",
       "fromAccountId": "account1-id",
       "toAccountId": "account1-id",  // Same as fromAccountId
       "amount": "100.00"
     }
     ```
     The API should return a 400 Bad Request indicating that transfers to the same account are not allowed.

   - **View Transaction History:**  
     Get transaction history for an account:
     ```
     GET /accounts/{accountId}/transactions?userId={userId}
     ```
     This will return all transactions for the specified account.

   - **View All Transactions (Audit):**  
     For audit purposes, use:
     ```
     GET /transactions
     ```
     This endpoint provides a complete transaction log for the entire system.

## Authentication Note

This is a demonstration application that uses `userId` in the request body for simplicity. In a production environment:

- User authentication would utilize JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or similar authentication mechanisms
- User identification and authorization would be handled through request headers, not request body
- Sensitive operations would require proper authentication tokens rather than passing user IDs directly
- Additional security measures like rate limiting, request validation, and audit logging would be implemented

The current implementation focuses on demonstrating the banking business logic rather than security practices.

## Domain-Driven Design Approach

The application follows some principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD), particularly with the `BankAccount` entity:

- **Rich Domain Model**: The `BankAccount` entity contains business methods like `deposit()` and `withdraw()` rather than being a simple data container. This is in contrast to the `User` and `Transaction` entities which are more data-centric.

- **Encapsulation of Business Rules**: The `BankAccount` entity encapsulates critical business rules such as:
  - Preventing negative balances during withdrawals
  - Validating transaction amounts
  - Managing the account balance

- **Logic in Entity vs. Service Layer**: While many applications put all business logic in service layers, this design deliberately places account-specific operations in the entity itself because:
  1. These operations directly affect the entity's state (balance)
  2. Business rules about balance management are intrinsic to what an account *is*, not just what it *does*
  3. This creates a more maintainable codebase where account-specific logic isn't spread across multiple services

This pattern ensures that the core domain logic can't be bypassed and that account balance modifications always follow the required business rules, regardless of which service is using the entity.
